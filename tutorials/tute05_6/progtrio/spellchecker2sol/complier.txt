A Java complier is a complier for the Java programming language.
The most common form of output from a Java complier is Java class files containing platform-neutral Java bytecode.
There exist also compliers emitting optimized native machine code for a particular hardware/operating system combination.

Most Java-to-bytecode compilers, Jikes being a well known exception, do virtually no optimization,
leaving this until run time to be done by the JRE[citation needed].

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loads the class files and either interprets the bytecode or 
just-in-time compiles it to machine code and then possibly optimizes it using dynamic compilation.

A standard on how to interact with Java compilers programmatically was specified in JSR 199.
